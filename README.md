# Problem Statement
Write two programs (one for standard and one for extended) that simulate the processing of an ACL at a routerâ€™s interface.

## Description
Each program should read two text files, one containing ACL statements, and another containing a list of IP addresses that represent packets coming into the interface. The input to the standard ACL program will be just a list of source IP addresses while the input to the extended ACL program will be a list of source IP address, destination IP address and port number. The program should process each packet according to the ACL statements and decide to permit or deny each packet.

## Assumptions
You may assume that the program is simulating the ACL (either in or out) at just one interface. You may also assume that the input files are error-free, that is, you need not check for syntax and IP address errors.

## Example for Standard ACL
**Read Input text file 1**  
access-list 3 deny 172.16.4.0 0.0.0.255  
access-list 3 permit 172.16.0.0 0.0.255.255  
interface EO  
ip access-group 3 out  

**Read Input text file 2 (consists of a list of source IP addresses)**  
172.16.4.1  
172.16.3.5  
201.15.3.4  

**Display the following output:**  
Packet from 172.16.4.1 denied  
Packet from 172.16.3.5 permitted  
Packet from 201.15.3.4 denied  

## Example for Extended ACL
**Read Input text file 1**  
access-list 101 deny tcp 172.16.0.0 0.0.255.255 172.16.3.0 0.0.0.255 range 20-21  
access-list 101 permit ip 172.16.0.0 0.0.255.255 172.16.3.0 0.0.0.255  
interface EO  
ip access-group 101 out  

**Read Input text file 2 (consists of a list of source IP, destination IP addresses and port numbers)**  
172.16.4.4 172.16.3.1 20  
172.16.4.4 172.16.3.5 22  
172.25.3.1 172.16.3.4 22  

**Display the following output:**  
Packet from 172.16.4.4 to 172.16.3.1 on port 20 denied  
Packet from 172.16.4.4 to 172.16.3.5 on port 22 permitted  
Packet from 172.25.3.1 to 172.16.3.4 on port 22 denied
